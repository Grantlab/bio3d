# Background {.unnumbered}
Bio3D[^1] is an R package that provides interactive tools for structural bioinformatics. The primary focus of Bio3D is the analysis of bimolecular structure, sequence and simulation data [@grant06].

Normal mode analysis (NMA) is one of the major simulation techniques used to probe large-scale motions in biomolecules. Typical application is for the prediction of functional motions in proteins. Version 2.0 of the Bio3D package now includes extensive NMA facilities [@skjaerven15]. These include a unique collection of multiple elastic network model force-fields, automated ensemble analysis methods, and variance weighted NMA (see also the [**NMA Vignette**](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/tutorials)). Here we provide an in-depth demonstration of ensemble NMA with working code that comprise complete executable examples[^2].

## Requirements {.unnumbered}
Detailed instructions for obtaining and installing the Bio3D package on various platforms can be found in the [**Installing Bio3D Vignette**](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/tutorials) available both on-line and from within the Bio3D package. In addition to Bio3D the _MUSCLE_ multiple sequence alignment program (available from the [muscle home page](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/) must be installed on your system and in the search path for executables. Please see the installation vignette for further details.

## About this document {.unnumbered}
This vignette was generated using **Bio3D version `r packageVersion("bio3d")`**.

# Part I: Ensemble NMA of *E.coli* DHFR structures
In this vignette we perform *ensemble NMA* on the complete
collection of *E.coli* Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) structures in the protein data-bank (PDB).
Starting from only one PDB identifier (PDB ID 1rx2) we show how to search the PDB for related structures using BLAST, fetch and align
the structures, and finally calculate the normal modes of each individual structure in order
to probe for potential differences in structural flexibility.

## Search and retrieve DHFR structures
Below we perform a blast search of the PDB database to identify related structures 
to our query *E.coli* DHFR sequence. In this particular example we use function 
**get.seq()** to fetch the query sequence for chain A of the PDB ID 1RX2 and use this as input to **blast.pdb()**. Note that 
**get.seq()** would also allow the corresponding UniProt identifier. 

```{r example1a, results="hide"}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r example1b, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE,}
aa <- get.seq("1rx2_A")
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```


Function **plot.blast()** facilitates the visualization and filtering of the Blast results. It will attempt
to set a seed position to the point of largest drop-off in normalized scores (i.e. the biggest jump in  E-values).
In this particular case we specify a cutoff  (after initial plotting) of 225 to include only the relevant *E.coli* structures:

```{r fig1-1, fig.height=6, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Blast results. Visualize and filter blast results through function **plot.blast()**. Here we proceed with only the top scoring hits (black)."}
hits <- plot(blast, cutoff=225)
```


The Blast search and subsequent filtering identified a total of 101 related PDB structures to our query sequence. 
The PDB identifiers of this collection are accessible through the `pdb.id` attribute to the `hits` object (`hits$pdb.id`). 
Note that adjusting the cutoff argument (to **plot.blast()**) will result in a decrease or
increase of hits. 

We can now use function **get.pdb()** and **pdbslit()** to fetch and parse the identified
structures. Finally, we use **pdbaln()** to align the PDB structures. 

```{r example1d1, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# fetch PDBs
raw.files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path = "raw_pdbs", gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r example1d2, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# split by chain ID
files <- pdbsplit(raw.files, ids = hits$pdb.id, path = "raw_pdbs/split_chain", ncore=4)
```

```{r example1d3, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# align structures
pdbs.all <- pdbaln(files, fit=TRUE)
```


The *pdbs.all* object now contains *aligned* C-alpha atom data, including Cartesian coordinates,
residue numbers, residue types, and B-factors. The sequence alignment is also stored by default
to the FASTA format file 'aln.fa' (to view this you can use an alignment viewer such as SEAVIEW,
see _Requirements_ section above). In cases where manual edits of the alignment are necessary
you can re-read the sequence alignment and coordinate data with:

```{r example1d4, eval=FALSE}
aln <- read.fasta('aln.fa')
pdbs.all <- read.fasta.pdb(aln)
```


At this point the *pdbs.all* object contains all identified 101 structures. This might include 
structures with missing residues, and/or multiple structurally redundant conformers. For our
subsequent NMA missing in-structure residues might bias the calculation, and redundant structures
can be useful to omit to reduce the computational load. Below we inspect the connectivity of the
PDB structures with a function call to **inspect.connectivity()**, and **trim.pdbs()** to
filter out those structures from our *pdbs.all* object. Similarly, we omit structures that are
conformationally redundant to reduce the computational load with function **filter.rmsd()**:

```{r example1e, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# remove structures with missing residues
conn <- inspect.connectivity(pdbs.all, cut=4.05)
pdbs <- trim.pdbs(pdbs.all, row.inds=which(conn))

# which structures are omitted
which(!conn)

# remove conformational redundant structures
rd <- filter.rmsd(pdbs$xyz, cutoff=0.1, fit=TRUE)
pdbs <- trim.pdbs(pdbs, row.inds=rd$ind)

# remove "humanized" e-coli dhfr
excl <- unlist(lapply(c("3QL0", "4GH8"), grep, pdbs$id))
pdbs <- trim.pdbs(pdbs, row.inds=which(!(1:length(pdbs$id) %in% excl)))

# a list of PDB codes of our final selection
ids <- unlist(strsplit(basename(pdbs$id), split=".pdb"))
```


Use **print()** to see a short summary of the pdbs object:

```{r example1f, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
print(pdbs, alignment=FALSE)
```


## Annotate collected PDB structures 
Function **pdb.annotate()** provides a convenient way of annotating the PDB
files we have collected. Below we use the function to annotate each structure to its
source species. This will come in handy when annotating plots later on:

```{r example1g, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE,}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
print(unique(anno$source))
```


## Principal component analysis
A principal component analysis (PCA) can be performed on the structural ensemble
(stored in the *pdbs* object) with function **pca.xyz()**. To obtain meaningful results
we first superimpose all structures on the *invariant core* (function **core.find()**).

```{r example1h1, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
# find invariant core
core <- core.find(pdbs)

# superimpose all structures to core
pdbs$xyz = pdbfit(pdbs, core$c0.5A.xyz)

# identify gaps, and perform PCA
gaps.pos <- gap.inspect(pdbs$xyz)
gaps.res <- gap.inspect(pdbs$ali)
pc.xray <- pca.xyz(pdbs$xyz[,gaps.pos$f.inds])
```

```{r example1h2, eval=FALSE}
# plot PCA
plot(pc.xray)
```


Note that a call to the wrapper function **pca()** would provide identical results as the above code:

```{r example1h3, eval=FALSE}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs, core.find=TRUE)
```


Function **rmsd()** will calculate all pairwise RMSD values of the structural ensemble. 
This facilitates clustering analysis based on the pairwise structural deviation:

```{r example1i, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=4)
```


```{r figi-1, fig.cap="Projection of the X-ray conformers shows that the E.coli DHFR structures can be divided into three major groups along their two first eigenvectors: closed, open, and occluded conformations. Each dot is colored according to their cluster membership: occluded conformations (green), open conformations (black), and closed conformations (red).", fig.height=5, fig.width=5,}
plot(pc.xray$z[,1:2], col="grey50", pch=16, cex=1.3,
     ylab="Prinipcal Component 2", xlab="Principal Component 1")
points(pc.xray$z[,1:2], col=grps.rd, pch=16, cex=0.9)
```


To visualize the major structural variations in the ensemble function **mktrj()** can be used to generate a trajectory
PDB file by interpolating along the eigenvector:

```{r example1hi2, eval=FALSE}
mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1,
      resno=pdbs$resno[1, gaps.res$f.inds],
      resid=pdbs$resid[1, gaps.res$f.inds])
```


Function **pdbfit()** can be used to write the PDB files to separate directories according to their cluster membership:

```{r example1j, eval=FALSE}
pdbfit(trim.pdbs(pdbs, row.inds=which(grps.rd==1)), outpath="grps1") ## closed
pdbfit(trim.pdbs(pdbs, row.inds=which(grps.rd==2)), outpath="grps2") ## open
pdbfit(trim.pdbs(pdbs, row.inds=which(grps.rd==3)), outpath="grps3") ## occluded
```


## Normal modes analysis
Function **nma.pdbs()** will calculate the normal modes of each protein structure stored
in the *pdbs* object. The normal modes are calculated on the full structures as provided
by object *pdbs*. With the default argument `rm.gaps=TRUE` unaligned atoms 
are omitted from output:

```{r example1k, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
modes <- nma.pdbs(pdbs, rm.gaps=TRUE, ncore=4)
```


The *modes* object of class *enma* contains aligned normal mode data including fluctuations,
RMSIP data, and aligned eigenvectors. A short summary of the *modes* object can be obtain by
calling the function **print()**, and the aligned fluctuations can be plotted with function
**plot.enma()**. This function also facilitates the calculation and visualization of sequence conservation
(use argument `conservation=TRUE`), and fluctuation variance (use argument `variance=TRUE`).

```{r example1l, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE,}
print(modes)
```

```{r fig1l-1, fig.cap="Normal mode fluctuations of the E.coli DHFR ensemble. (**upper panel**) Each line represent the mode fluctuations for the individual structures. Color coding according to structural clustering: green (occluded), black (open), and red (closed). (**lower panel**) Variance of mode fluctuations. The Met20 loop seems to display the largest deviations / differences in predicted fluctuations. ", fig.height=6, fig.width=6,}
# plot modes fluctuations
plot(modes, pdbs=pdbs, col=grps.rd, variance=TRUE)
```

```{r example1m, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE,}
hc.nma <- hclust(as.dist(1-modes$rmsip))
grps.nma <- cutree(hc.nma, k=4)
```

```{r fig1m-1, fig.cap="Clustering of structures based on their normal modes similarity (in terms of pair-wise RMSIP values)."}
heatmap(1-modes$rmsip, distfun = as.dist, labRow = ids, labCol = ids,
        ColSideColors=as.character(grps.nma), RowSideColors=as.character(grps.nma))
```


## Fluctuation analysis
Comparing the mode fluctuations of two groups of structures 
can reveal specific regions of distinct flexibility patterns. Below we focus on the
differences between the open (black), closed (red) and occluded (green) conformations
of the *E.coli* structures: 

```{r fig1n-1, fig.cap="Comparison of mode fluctuations between open (black) and closed (red) conformers. Significant differences among the mode fluctuations between the two groups are marked with shaded blue regions.", fig.height=4, fig.width=6,}
cols <- grps.rd
cols[which(cols!=1 & cols!=2)]=NA
plot(modes, pdbs=pdbs, col=cols, signif=TRUE)
```

```{r fig1n-2, fig.cap="Comparison of mode fluctuations between open (black) and occluded (green) conformers. Significant differences among the mode fluctuations between the two groups are marked with shaded blue regions.", fig.height=4, fig.width=6,}
cols <- grps.rd
cols[which(cols!=1 & cols!=3)]=NA
plot(modes, pdbs=pdbs, col=cols, signif=TRUE)
```

```{r fig1n-3, fig.cap="Comparison of mode fluctuations between closed (red) and occluded (green) conformers. Significant differences among the mode fluctuations between the two groups are marked with shaded blue regions.", fig.height=4, fig.width=6,}
cols <- grps.rd
cols[which(grps.rd!=2 & grps.rd!=3)]=NA
plot(modes, pdbs=pdbs, col=cols, signif=TRUE)
```


## Compare with MD simulation
The above analysis can also nicely be integrated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Below we read in a 5 ns long MD trajectory (of PDB ID 1RX2). We visualize the conformational sampling by projecting the MD conformers onto the principal components (PCs) of the X-ray ensemble, and finally compare the PCs of the MD simulation to the normal modes:

```{r example1o, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
pdb <- read.pdb("md-traj/1rx2-CA.pdb")
trj <- read.ncdf("md-traj/1rx2_5ns.nc")

inds <- pdb2aln.ind(pdbs, pdb, gaps.res$f.inds)
inds.core <- pdb2aln.ind(pdbs, pdb, core$c0.5A.atom)

# inds$a is for the pdbs object
# inds$b is for the MD structure

trj.fit <- fit.xyz(pdbs$xyz[1,], trj, core$c0.5A.xyz, inds.core$b$xyz)
proj <- project.pca(trj.fit[, inds$b$xyz], pc.xray)
cols <- densCols(proj[,1:2])
```

```{r fig1o-1, fig.cap="Projection of MD conformers onto the X-ray PC space provides a two dimensional representation of the conformational sampling along the MD simulation (blue dots).", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=4.5,}
plot(proj[,1:2], col=cols, pch=16,
     ylab="Prinipcal Component 2", xlab="Principal Component 1",
     xlim=range(pc.xray$z[,1]), ylim=range(pc.xray$z[,2]))
points(pc.xray$z[,1:2], col=1, pch=1, cex=1.1)
points(pc.xray$z[,1:2], col=grps.rd, pch=16)
```

```{r example1p, eval=TRUE}
# PCA of the MD trajectory
pc.md <- pca.xyz(trj.fit[, inds$b$xyz])

# compare MD-PCA and NMA
r <- rmsip(pc.md$U, modes$U.subspace[,,1])

print(r)
```

```{r fig1p-1, fig.cap="Overlap map between normal modes and principal components of a 5 ns long MD simulation. The two subsets yields an RMSIP value of 0.64, where a value of 1 would idicate identical directionality.", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=4.5,}
plot(r, xlab="MD PCA", ylab="NMA")

# compare MD-PCA and X-rayPCA
r <- rmsip(pc.md, pc.xray)
```


## Domain analysis with GeoStaS
Identification of regions in the protein that move as rigid bodies is facilitated
with the implementation of the GeoStaS algorithm [@Romanowska2012a]. Below we demonstrate the use of function
**geostas()** on data obtained from ensemble NMA, an ensemble of PDB structures, and a 5 ns long
MD simulation. See `help(geostas)` for more details and further examples.

**GeoStaS on a PDB ensemble**: Below we input the `pdbs` object to function
**geostas()** to identify dynamic domains. Here, we attempt to divide the structure into
2 sub-domains using argument `k=2`. Function **geostas()** will return a `grps` attribute
which corresponds to the domain assignment for each C-alpha atom in the structure.
Note that we use argument `fit=FALSE` to avoid re-fitting the coordinates since. Recall that
the coordinates of the `pdbs` object has already been superimposed to the identified
invariant core (see above). To visualize the domain assignment we write a PDB trajectory
of the first principal component (of the Cartesian coordinates of the `pdbs` object),
and add argument `chain=gs.xray$grps` to replace the chain identifiers with the domain
assignment:

```{r example1_gs-pdbs, cache=TRUE, results="hide",}
# Identify dynamic domains
gs.xray <- geostas(pdbs, k=2, fit=FALSE)

# Visualize PCs with colored domains (chain ID)
mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, chain=gs.xray$grps)
```


**GoeStaS on ensemble NMA**: We can also identify dynamic domains from the normal modes of the ensemble
of 82 protein structures stored in the `modes` object. By using function **mktrj.enma()**
we generate a trajectory from the first five modes for all 82 structures. We then input this
trajectory to function **geostas()**:

```{r example1_gs-nma, cache=TRUE,}
# Build conformational ensemble
trj.nma <- mktrj.enma(modes, pdbs, m.inds=1:5, s.inds=NULL, mag=10, step=2, rock=FALSE)

trj.nma

# Fit to invariant core
trj.nma <- fit.xyz(trj.nma[1,], trj.nma,
                   fixed.inds=core$c0.5A.xyz,
                   mobile.inds=core$c0.5A.xyz)

# Run geostas to find domains
gs.nma <- geostas(trj.nma, k=2, fit=FALSE)

```{r example1_gs-nma2, eval=FALSE,}
# Write NMA generated trajectory with domain assignment
write.pdb(xyz=trj.nma, chain=gs.nma$grps)
```

Note that function **geostas.enma()** wraps these three main functions calls to faciliatet this calculation. 
See `help(geostas)` for more information. 


**GeoStaS on a MD trajectory**: The domain analysis can also be performed on the trajectory data obtained
from the MD simulation (see above). Recall that the MD trajectory has already been superimposed
to the invariant core. We therefore use argument `fit=FALSE` below. We then perform a
new PCA of the MD trajectory, and visualize the domain assingments with function **mktrj()**:

```{r example1_gs-md, cache=TRUE, results="hide",}
gs.md <- geostas(trj, k=2, fit=FALSE)
pc.md <- pca(trj, fit=FALSE)
mktrj(pc.md, pc=1, chain=gs.md$grps)
```

## Measures for modes comparison
Bio3D now includes multiple measures for the assessment of similarity between two normal mode
objects. This enables clustering of related proteins based on the predicted modes of motion.
Below we demonstrate the use of root mean squared inner product (RMSIP), squared inner product (SIP), covariance overlap, bhattacharyya coefficient, and PCA of the corresponding covariance matrices. 

```{r example1q-sip, eval=TRUE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# Similarity of atomic fluctuations
sip <- sip(modes)
hc.sip <- hclust(as.dist(1-sip), method="ward.D2")
grps.sip <- cutree(hc.sip, k=3)
```

```{r fig1q-sip, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Dendrogram shows the results of hierarchical clustering of structures based on the similarity of atomic fluctuations calculated from NMA.
