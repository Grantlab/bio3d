\title{ Download FASTA Sequence Files }
\description{
  Downloads FASTA sequence files from the NCBI nr, SWISSPROT/UNIPROT,
  OR RCSB PDB databases.
}
\usage{
get.seq(ids, outfile = "seqs.fasta", db = "nr", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ids}{ A character vector of one or more appropriate database
    codes/identifiers of the files to be downloaded. }
  \item{outfile}{ A single element character vector specifying the name
    of the local file to which sequences will be written. }
  \item{db}{ A single element character vector specifying the database
    from which sequences are to be obtained. }
  \item{verbose}{ logical, if TRUE URL details of the download process
    are printed. }
}
\details{
  This is a basic function to automate sequence file download from the 
  databases including NCBI nr, SWISSPROT/UNIPROT, and RCSB PDB.
}
\value{
  If all files are successfully downloaded a list object with two
  components is returned:
  \item{ali }{ an alignment character matrix with a row per sequence and
    a column per equivalent aminoacid/nucleotide. }
  \item{ids }{ sequence names as identifiers.}
  This is similar to that returned by \code{\link{read.fasta}}. However,
  if some files were not successfully downloaded then a vector detailing
  which ids were not found is returned.
