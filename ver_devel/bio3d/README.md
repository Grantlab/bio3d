# Documentation

The Bio3D package for structural bioinformatics consists of sets of functions for:

- <a href="#Input/Output:">input/output</a>,
- <a href="#Sequence Analysis:">sequence analysis</a>, 
- <a href="#Structure Analysis:">structure analysis</a>,
- <a href="#Trajectory Analysis:">simulation analysis</a>,
- <a href="#Normal Mode Analysis:">normal mode analysis</a>, 
- <a href="#Correlation Network Analysis:"> correlation network analysis</a>,
- <a href="#Utilities:">format conversion and data manipulation</a>, and 
- <a href="#Graphics:">graphics and visualization.</a>. 
 
Major functions are listed below with links to further documentation that includes example code and results. 

Note that you can also get help on any particular function by using the command `?function` or `help(function)` (e.g. `help(read.pdb)`) and directly execute the example code for a given function with the command `example(function)` from within R itself. 

We also distribute a number of extended **Bio3D vignettes** that provide worked examples of using Bio3D to perform a particular type of analysis. Currently available vignettes include:

There is also extensive [on-line documentation](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/reference/) with worked examples (and their output) for all functions and a package manual (in [PDF](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bio3d/bio3d.pdf) format) that is a concatenation of each functions documentation (without example output).
