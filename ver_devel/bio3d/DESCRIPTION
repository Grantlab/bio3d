Description: Utilities to process, organize and explore protein structure, 
    sequence and dynamics data.  Features include the ability to read and 
    write structure, sequence and dynamic trajectory data, perform sequence 
    and structure database searches, data summaries, atom selection, 
    alignment, superposition, rigid core identification, clustering, 
    torsion analysis, distance matrix analysis, structure and sequence 
    conservation analysis, normal mode analysis, principal component 
    analysis of heterogeneous structure data, and correlation network   
    analysis from normal mode and molecular dynamics data.  In addition, 
    various utility functions are provided to enable the statistical and 
    graphical power of the R environment to work with biological sequence 
    and structural data.  Please refer to the URLs below for more information.
