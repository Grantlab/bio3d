v2.3
Version 2.3, released in September 2016, contains new facilities for
ensemble normal mode analysis (NMA) with all-atom elastic network model (ENM) 
and Gaussian network model (GNM), enhanced NMA calculation with 
rotation-translation block (RTB) method and "4-bead" coarse-grained ENM, 
more efficiently reading large PDB files using Rcpp, 
PDB annotation from PFAM database, and more supported I/O file format.

We have also updated online vignettes and other documentations.

Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>-<patch>

E.g.: 2.0-1

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
