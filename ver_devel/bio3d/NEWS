v2.2
Version 2.2, released in Feb 2015, contains new facilities for 
sub-optimal path analysis of biomolecular correlation networks, 
constructing biological units, identification and tidying of 
malformed PDB files, and improved secondary structure annotation of 
'pdbs' objects and various plots.  We have also updated and enhanced 
atom selection functionality and developed a new vignette detailing 
PDB structure manipulation and analysis facilities. For a fine-
grained list of changes, or to report a bug, please consult:

* [The commit log](https://bitbucket.org/Grantlab/bio3d/commits/all)

Major new functions include:
* cnapath: Suboptimal Path Analysis for Correlation Networks
* biounit: Biological Unit Construction
* clean.pdb: Inspect And Clean Up A PDB Object

v2.1
----
Version 2.1, released in Sep 2014,  contains new facilities for Correlation 
Network Analysis (cna) and Geometrically Stable Domain finding (geostas). 
We have also changed 'PDB object data' storage from a matrix to a data.frame 
format. Improved methods and functionality for ensemble NMA are now also  
included along with extensive improvements to package vignettes and function 
documentation. For a fine-grained list of changes, or to report a bug,

Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>-<patch>

E.g.: 2.0-1

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
