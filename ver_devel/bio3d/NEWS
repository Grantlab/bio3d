v2.1
Version 2.1 contains new facilities for Correlation Network Analysis (cna) and 
Geometrically Stable Domain finding (geostas). We have also changed PDB object data 
storage from a matrix to a data.frame format. Improved methods and functionality 
for ensemble NMA are now also included along with extensive improvements to existing 
code and documentation. For a fine-grained list of changes, or to report a 
bug, please consult:

Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>-<patch>

E.g.: 2.0-1

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
